1. Extract the archive into a folder. **Do not extract into the game folder.**
2. Move the contents of `plugins` folder into `<GameDirectory>\Bepinex\plugins`.
3. Start the server (or game), it will generate automatically an configuration file into `<GameDirectory>\Bepinex\config`

## Config

The config is fairly well documented. 

Under `Events`, you can toggle which events you want to receive on the webhook
Under `General` are the basic config settings. Make sure you set the "WebhookUrl" here.
