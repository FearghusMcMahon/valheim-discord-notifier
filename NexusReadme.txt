# Valheim Discord Notifier

### Note

This mod only works on servers (Dedicated and Non-Dedicated). 

## Installation (manual)

1. Extract the archive into a folder. **Do not extract into the game folder.**
2. Move the contents of `DiscordNotifier` folder into `<GameDirectory>\Bepinex\plugins` (should create a `<GameDirectory>Bepinex\plugins\DiscordNotifier` directory)
3. Start the server (or game), it will generate automatically an configuration file into `<GameDirectory>\Bepinex\config\CryptikLemur_DiscordNotifier.cfg` and `<GameDirectory>\Bepinex\config\CryptikLemur_DiscordNotifier.messages.json`

## Config

The config is fairly well documented. 

Under `Events`, you can toggle which events you want to receive on the webhook
Under `General` are the basic config settings. Make sure you set the "WebhookUrl" here.
